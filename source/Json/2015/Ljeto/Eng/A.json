It’s okay if girls want to dress up because proms are a reflection of a generation’s current “fashions and dance” - in the same way that it is a reflection of our larger culture. No, don’t take away students’ proms. They need them, as much as they need any aspect of their future adult life."

They also seem to be paralyzed with self-esteem and self-importance. A prom is a great way to help them learn to deal with these issues."

I think schools should set limits and say what is acceptable and make it affordable for all, right?

In 2011 a six-person national squad came first at the World Team Chess Championship in Russia. That group included up-and-coming player Levon Aronian, 28, currently third in the World Chess Federation’s rankings. These contemporary exploits have fostered a recent craze for this mind-training board game. Indeed, a new move could make it even bigger: mandatory chess in school. The educational authorities of this former Soviet republic have made the game part of the primary school curriculum, along with such standards as maths and history, for children between the ages of seven and nine.\n\nArmenian authorities say teaching chess in school is about building character, not breeding chess champions. The education minister says taking the pastime into the classroom will help nurture a sense of organisation among schoolchildren and will teach them the importance of taking care of their duties. “We hope that the Armenian teaching model might become among the best in the world,” said Rehan Ashotyan. Half a million dollars were allocated to the national chess academy to draw up a course, create textbooks, train instructors and buy equipment. A further $1 million was paid for furniture for chess classrooms.\n\nContinuing the line of successful chess players, Armenia now has an eight-year-old champion, David Ayrapetyan. His parents are hoping that the programme will give him an opponent worthy of his skills. The chess whiz finds the local retirees and fellow children to be pushovers. Only his classmate Aren can give him a run for his money. David’s parents say chess is good for him, no matter what the future holds. Their assumption is that, even if he doesn’t become a grandmaster or doesn’t join the national chess team, chess will certainly teach him to think logically and improvise, as those are indispensable qualities in life.\n\nWendi Fischer, executive director of the US Foundation for Chess, has campaigned for the game to be taken up in American classrooms and labels Armenia’s programme as undoubtedly positive. “By playing chess in class, the children think they’re playing, while they are actually doing some serious thinking all the time,” she said. “So it is a great way to cross over between having a true hard-core curriculum that’s mandatory and giving young children the chance to play and explore and have fun.”\n\nUnlike so many addictive computer games with hardly any upsides, chess is said to teach problem-solving skills, self-discipline and the sheer pleasure of competition. Some classroom observations in primary schools proved that the children do love playing it, though there are some objections to outbursts of bad temper when they lose, and sometimes tears. Adults have acquired the ability to cope with such strong emotions or at least to conceal them, which children have yet to master. They ought to be taught that being gracious in defeat is an important part of the game.\n\nThe newly introduced chess curriculum might even help the children beat the odds against artificial intelligence. A £30 chess program can now beat the world champion. But for the ordinary mortal, trying to fathom the best move in each situation, to arrive at what grandmasters call the “truth” of a position, is endlessly demanding. There lies the real joy of winning a game of chess. The Armenians believe that they are giving their children a useful tool with which to approach life."

But its reign is obviously over. In its place, a new generation of services is starting to take hold. (19) ___. Just as email did more than a decade ago, this shift promises to profoundly rewrite the way we communicate - in ways we can only begin to imagine.\n\nWe still use email, of course. But email was better suited to the way we used to use the internet - logging off and on, checking our messages in bursts. (20) ___. Being online all the time has created a host of new ways to communicate that are faster than email, and more fun.\n\nWhy wait for a response to an email when you get a quicker answer with instant messaging? Thanks to social networks, some questions can be answered without even asking them. (21) ___. Email, stuck in the era of attachments, seems boring compared to services which allow users to share photos plus other information and to enter comments in near real-time.\n\nSo how will these new tools change the way we communicate? Let’s start with the most obvious: they make our interactions that much faster. Years ago, we were frustrated if it took a few days for a letter to arrive. A couple of years ago, we’d complain about a half-hour delay in getting an email. (22) ___. In a few months, we may be complaining that our cell phones aren’t automatically able to send messages to friends within a certain distance, letting them know we’re nearby.\n\nThese new services also make communicating more frequent and informal - more like a blog comment or a throwaway aside, rather than a crafted email sent to one person. There is no need to spend time writing a long email to your half-dozen closest friends about how your vacation went. (23) ___. Instead of sending a few emails a week to a handful of friends, you can send dozens of messages a day to hundreds of people who know you, or just barely do.\n\nMeanwhile, one big question remains: will the new services save time, or eat up even more of it? You can argue that, because we have more ways to send more messages, we spend more time doing it. (24) ___. We get lured into wasting time, telling our bosses we are looking into something, instead of just doing it, for example. And we will no doubt waste time communicating stuff that isn’t meaningful, maybe at the expense of more meaningful communication - such as, say, talking to somebody in person."
