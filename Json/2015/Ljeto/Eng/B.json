While growing up in the Garston area of Watford, she regularly played football on boys’ teams. She also did gymnastics, and she credits her skateboarding skill and fast progression to being good at it. Her skateboarding mates even called her ‘Jimmy’, short for ‘gymnastics’, and her old friends still do.\n\nAmber skates every evening and at weekends with her friend ‘Speedy’. As soon as she finishes her job as a sales assistant in a local sports shop, she’s on her board and skating through the streets or in the skate park on half-pipes. “I love skateboarding. It helps me to be me. It’s how I feel free.”\n\nAmber has won regional competitions and is now going to the national championship. “But we’re not really competing against each other. We’re just doing our own thing together.” At local competitions, she wears a T-shirt with Morton, the name of the sports shop where she works, on it. “They give me free gear, like Croft Boards, and time off before competitions,” she explains.\n\nWill she turn professional? “I don’t know. But I don’t see skateboarding as a career. I must say I’d love to be an astronaut and do space walks. But, until then, I might stay where I am.”"
