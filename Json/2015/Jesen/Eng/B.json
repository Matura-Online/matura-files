It all started with her hobby of taking food photographs while she was studying Criminology at the University of Toronto, in her home town.\n\nMariah’s mum, a successful Canadian painter, had high hopes for her only child. She wanted her to become an artist like herself. But Mariah decided to become a food stylist. “A food stylist is an artist of their own,” says Mariah. “Anytime you’re presenting food, you have to start with the idea that you need good composition, good textures and colours, so there are always all of these elements of art,” says this Vancouver-based food stylist.\n\nIt is a difficult task to break into the food styling industry, so it was not easy to succeed. She had to knock on doors, make phone calls and show up personally just to get a job. It was even more difficult being a single working mum of 12-year-old twins. However, their father, Peter (35), who now lives in Ottawa, spends his weekends with them.\n\n“Our marriage just didn’t work,” says Mariah. “We were only 21, probably too young. Although we divorced in the end, we stayed good friends. He will be at my wedding next month in Montreal. I feel at 35 I’m ready for a romantic relationship.”\n\nIt hasn’t been easy for Mariah, but now she is a successful food stylist who works for celebrity chefs and top cooking magazines."
