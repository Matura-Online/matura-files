Now everywhere seemed the same; everyone seemed to be dressed the same. Perhaps I had changed. I missed the atmosphere of adventure and began to regret my decision.

                        "text": "Stanley Cook was in the Guinness Book of Records from 1967 to 1993 as the tallest man in England, where he was reported to have measured 8ft 4in (2.44m) - a fact that, his greatnephew, Jim Cook, who lives in Ontario, Canada, and has researched Stanley’s life, says is an exaggeration.\n\nStanley Cook was born in 1891 in London, the second youngest of four sons. After his father died on Christmas Day, 1899, his mother struggled to make ends meet, and Cook, then aged eight, and his two-year-old brother George were placed in care. “He was remarkably tall for his age,” said Jim Cook. “He was a happy boy, who realized it paid to entertain the others and make them laugh.” The brothers were sent to homes in Canada to learn agricultural skills, but Cook was unfit for farm work and, in 1909, he returned to England to find factory work.\n\nIn the spring of 1911, Cook was the tallest man in a parade of giants as part of the celebrations for the coronation of King George V. He was said to stand 7ft 4in tall, and the attention he received from the press and public was his first indication that his unusual height might be a means to make a living away from a factory. He was approached by Don Banks, who offered to find him work in Ashton’s Circus.\n\n“Of course Stanley was a freak,” said his great-nephew, “and that’s what people paid to see. He was free to travel since he didn’t have a home of his own or anything to keep him where he was. And he was a happy, well-adjusted chap. He liked to talk to the public and see them enjoy themselves.” In June 1911 Cook earned his first salary as a professional giant in Ashton’s Circus at Chigwell in Essex.\n\n“His height could be seen as a blessing,” said Jim Cook, “because it gave him a life he could never otherwise have enjoyed,” including a tour of Europe in early 1914. His picture appeared in newspapers all over the world. “Suddenly newspapers were reporting that he stood 8ft 11in.”\n\nJim Cook believes his manager, Don Banks, was the source of this. “He made the most of Stanley’s size. Of course Don ‘stretched’ the truth. He just wanted to bring in the crowds.” Stanley claimed he was 8ft 4in and continued to do so for the rest of his life. His doctor’s case notes say he stood 7ft 9in tall, which is now known to have been the case.\n\nStanley stayed with the circus until his death in 1918, aged 27. “He died young, but he had a unique life,’’ said Jim. “He travelled widely, had a good working relationship with Don, who never took advantage of him, and the circus provided him with a family.”\n\nFor Jim Cook, his great-uncle’s fame has enabled long-lost family members to find each other. “I’ve been to places I’d never have been, doing this research, from Canada to Britain, the States and Australia. The expenses have been huge, and well worth it. I’d say that its role in helping me reconnect with family has been its greatest gift to me. It’s nice to think that Stanley is still remembered after all these years.”"

Chances are you used words such as “shy” or “confident”, “friendly” or “reserved”. When trying to understand our own, or other people’s behaviour, we tend to fall back on these psychological categories without even thinking. (0) ___. Of course, in reality none of us is so easily defined.\n\nAnd yet the desire to define ourselves is undeniable. Personality, by which we generally mean the thoughts, feelings and behaviour that make each of us individual, fascinates and challenges us. (19) ___. Meanwhile, our identity and relation to the world is defined in the categories psychologists and scientists have identified.\n\nIn reality, we are all made up of conflicting traits. (20) ___. For example, we can be careful and controlling in one area but spontaneous thrill-seekers in another. So can the contradictory nature of human behaviour ever be neatly classified into a set of universal traits? The Victorians certainly thought so.\n\nTowards the end of the nineteenth century, Sir Francis Galton pioneered an approach called lexical analysis, proposing that the most significant personality differences in people’s lives were encoded in their language. (21) ___. This theory was debated and refined over the next 100 years. In 1936, US psychologists Gordon Allport and H. S. Odbert extracted almost 18,000 personality-describing words and reduced them to around 5,000 common traits.\n\nSoon after, psychologist Raymond Cattell took those terms and reduced them further to 171 and then to 16. He then identified five broad traits that came to be known as “the big five”: openness, neuroticism, conscientiousness, extroversion and agreeableness. (22) ___. If, say, you register high in openness, you are likely to be emotionally adventurous, willing to try new things and intellectually curious.\n\nBut what, you may be wondering, was the point of focusing so intently on personality research? What did researchers such as Galton and Cattell hope to gain? (23) ___. Personality is only of interest to psychologists if it can give them information about how we’re likely to behave - now and in the future.\n\nRita Carter has recently published research which argues that people behave differently depending on context. (24) ___. “Instead of saying we’re one particular type,” she says, “it is more complex. You need to examine each of our individual personalities and then look at how they fight each other.”\n\nAre we entirely predictable creatures that can be classified according to a finite number of traits, or do we adapt according to our mood and situation? The debate continues."
