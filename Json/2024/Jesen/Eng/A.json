I have also compiled a script of useful phrases I have picked up while doing the shopping or reading notices in public places. Then, in the city where I am currently living there is a regular language-immersion meet-up group with a tutor, which joins people practising the language together in a carefree way, etc. This has given me the opportunity to absorb it as often as possible in many ways.

                        "text": "There are few things more quintessentially British than afternoon tea, where pride of place is taken by a pile of warm, fluffy scones smothered in clotted cream and topped with delicious strawberry jam. Doughy, crumbly and still warm from the oven, scones are a staple in TV shows like ‘The Great British Bake Off’ and ‘Escape to the Country’. Is it possible to have too much of a good thing?\n\nOne British woman combined her passion for scones and the country’s rich historical heritage in a unique and quirky project that has been described by fellow Brits in terms ranging from “odd” to “funny in the head” but has been recorded in a popular blog. Betty Masters aimed to eat one scone in every single UK Legacy property, and she completed her decade-long ‘odyssey’ last week as she tucked into - predictably - a scone and cuppa with milk and sugar at a stately home in Northern Ireland. “It’s all been incredibly rewarding!” said the 45-year-old travel agent, sharing her culinary achievement with a clutch of reporters from across the world, “I’m never, ever sick of scones!”\n\nUK Legacy is a conservation organisation founded in the late-19th century that safeguards sites like castles, stately homes, beaches and acres of rolling countryside across the land. For their annual subscription of £50 per year, its 7.5 million members have a free pass to the organisation’s many sites - as well as credit for contributing to the upkeep of the country’s rich and varied heritage. The organisation is synonymous with respectability, volunteering and middle-class people who are choosy about the kinds of places they patronise and for whom membership is a discreet, even hidden, badge of honour. It was founded several decades ago, at a time when the luxurious world depicted in programmes such as ‘Downton Abbey’ and ‘Poirot’ was reaching its end and mounting running costs making the maintenance of grand houses and estates increasingly difficult. Thanks to its efforts, millions have been able to access these and other national treasures.\n\nUK Legacy’s popular tea shops are a valuable source of revenue, selling over 3 million scones a year. What makes the scone its best-selling item and, equally importantly, is there a correct way to pronounce it? There are two schools of thought regarding what is by now a classic question. “Scone rhymes with tone!” asserts Jessica Taylor, a 65-year-old retired physiotherapist, in the tea shop at Broome Abbey in Nottinghamshire. “Don’t be daft, it rhymes with gone!” counters her colleague Pam Smith, 59, a part-time factory worker (who claims volunteering “gets her out of the house”), “She just thinks she’s posh!” It is a common misapprehension. In fact, there is an even balance in pronunciations across the south of England, though Pam’s predominates in Northern England and Scotland.\n\nThe gift of scone-making, both attest, lies in “cold cream, cold eggs - and colder butter,” although their tried and tested hand-me-down family recipes have marked differences: Jessica swears by sultanas and a pinch of cinnamon, while Pam confides that “half a cup of grated cheddar” is what makes hers special. “Scones are everybody’s cup of tea,” says Betty Masters, stating that a good rise is also important. What were her standout moments from her decade of research? She mentions a Christmas pudding scone in North Wales meant for the gift-giving season that literally vanished from the shelves. And at Andrew Carnegie’s birthplace in Dunfermline, there were no scones, but the millionaire’s shortbread won at a contest. We end our interview in a neighbourhood café with - you’ve guessed it - tea and scones!"

(0) ____. These individuals, who have gathered a significant following on social media platforms, hold a unique position as trendsetters and opinion leaders. The phenomenon has completely revolutionised the notion of influence, transforming the way people grasp information, make purchasing decisions and engage with brands.\n\nSo, what does it take and how is it done? Whereas some influencers can attribute their popularity to sophisticated education and exceptional expertise, others monetise their charisma or a sense of humour that enables them to capture and entertain audiences. They often focus on niches - specific segments within a broader market or field. (19) ____. By creating compelling content related to corresponding products or services, they inspire, inform and entertain millions of people worldwide.\n\nThe expansion of the influencer marketing phenomenon can undoubtedly be linked to the power of social media. (20) ____. Unlike in traditional advertising, a more personal and authentic approach to promotion is achieved. There is a sense of confidence in the person that one feels towards a trusted peer, making their recommendations and endorsements highly influential.\n\nThe most successful influencers have become powerful drivers of consumer behaviour. With their persuasive storytelling skill and as an integral part of the consumer decision-making process, they stimulate a desire for a variety of products. (21) ____. The whole idea of marketing and financial success has been changed due to this ability to shape trends and introduce new lines.\n\nNevertheless, the influencer industry has encountered a few challenges and ethical considerations. One concern is the issue of authenticity. (22) ____. Naturally, the followers question these individuals’ credibility. Additionally, the line between organic content and sponsored posts can sometimes blur, raising questions about transparency and disclosure. As a result, regulations and guidelines regarding sponsored content have emerged to protect consumers and ensure transparency.\n\nAlongside the rise of ‘traditional’ influencers with millions of followers, micro-influencers have gained prominence. (23) ____. This leads to increased trust and stronger impact. Brands are recognising the potential of collaborating with them to target niche markets effectively and create more authentic connections with consumers.\n\nThis new occupation has also influenced cultural and social norms. The advertising role has been expanded by significant input evident in shaping beauty standards, lifestyle choices, and even political opinions. Debates have been sparked about social media inauthenticity, the impact on mental health and the potential for encouraging unrealistic expectations. (24) ____.\n\nThe phenomenon of influencers has irreversibly changed the landscape of social influence. Their rise to prominence highlights the power of digital media in connecting individuals using new forms of communication. While influencers have revolutionised marketing and consumer behaviour, challenges surrounding authenticity, transparency and social impact persist. As society continues to adapt to the grip of digital platforms, understanding the role of influencers becomes crucial in navigating this dynamic and evolving arena."

Of course, we need to take (34) ___ consideration that the character of Juliet, who asks the question originally, is trying to justify her romantic interest in Romeo, who just happens to bear the last name of Juliet’s family’s sworn enemies.\n\nLet us now fast-forward to a time five centuries later when researchers decided to pose the question of what influence our names had on us and, (35) ___ Shakespeare and his quite progressive world views, actually found out the opposite. Our names determine us much more than they (36) ___ ever thought. Interestingly, independent research, conducted in 2013 and 2015 respectively, found that our names determined our lives to the extent of us opting for our careers, developing talents or having interests based on our first or last names.\n\nDubbed nominative determinism, this phenomenon explained why there was an inordinately large number of medical professionals with such names (37) ___ Payne, Butcher or Medina, as well as lawyers named Lawrence or Laurence. But the pressure our names put on us doesn’t stop there. According to the same research, even our talents and interests are affected. Therefore, someone like Usain Bolt had no other choice but to become the fastest man on the planet, (38) ___ did the poet William Wordsworth have any say (39) ___ choosing his profession.
